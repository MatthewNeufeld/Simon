# Simon

Given an HTMl and CSS template, I wrote the Javascript code to make a web application where you can play the game of simon. The coloured boxes will flash in a sequence and it is the player's task to remember the sequence correctly.

# What I learned

- How to use jQuery in my web applications
- Deepened my understanding of game logic using Javascript
